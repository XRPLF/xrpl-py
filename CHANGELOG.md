## [[Unreleased]]
### Added
- Sync and async `generate_faucet_wallet` functions now support a custom
  faucet host

## [1.3.0] - 2021-12-17
### Added
- Support for the [XLS-20 NFT proposal](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/46)
- `xrpl.models.amounts.get_amount_value` helper function
- `xrpl.utils.str_to_hex` and `xrpl.utils.hex_to_str` helpers
- `ledger_index` optional param for all the main account methods
- `TicketCreate` transaction model
- `GenericRequest` model for unsupported request types
- Methods to convert between `IssuedCurrency` and `IssuedCurrencyAmount`
- Support for ints and floats in the `IssuedCurrency` and `IssuedCurrencyAmount` models (and ints for `XRP`)
- Fixed bug where autofilling using an `xAddress` with `None` in the Destination Tag threw a KeyError
- `max_fee` and `fee_type` optional params for `get_fee`
- `autofill`, a new public method that populates the `fee`, `sequence`, and `last_ledger_sequence` fields of a transaction, based on the current state retrieved from the server the Client is connected to. It also converts all X-Addresses to classic addresses.
- Exports `Transaction`, `Response`, pseudo-transactions at the `xrpl.models` level

### Fixed
- Improves typing of `Response.result`
- Makes the default ledger version for `get_next_valid_seq_number` `current` instead of `validated`
- Stops erroring on non-`tesSUCCESS` responses in reliable transaction submission
- Removes runtime asserts in websocket clients that were used for type checks only
- Adds missing top-level `py.typed` file for exceptions and constants
- Fix issue where unsupported currency codes weren't being correctly processed in the binary codec
- Fixes issue with UNLModify encoding (due to a bug in rippled)
- Makes the account delete fee dynamic, based on the ledger's reserve, instead of hard-coded
- Fee scaling based on load on the ledger
- Fixes potential issue with conflicting Decimal contexts

## [1.2.0] - 2021-11-09
### Added
- Support for Python 3.10

### Fixed
- Improves documentation on using websocket clients.
- Fixes an issue sending NoRippleCheck requests
- Allows projects that use xrpl-py as a dependency to use typing

## [1.1.1] - 2021-07-02
### Fixed
- Fixes an issue encoding some non-standard currency values
- Corrects installation instructions in documentation

## [1.1.0] - 2021-06-16
### Added
- Option for `Transaction.flags` to be a `List` of `int`s instead of just an `int`
- Instance method in `Transaction` objects to calculate their hashes locally
- Additional reliability to `send_reliable_submission` by getting the hash before submitting
- Pseudo-transaction models
- Optional parameters for `get_transaction_from_hash`: `binary`, `min_ledger` and `max_ledger`
- Enum for `PaymentChannelClaim` flags
- Optional parameter to check if the `Transaction` fee is not too high before signing it
- Additional X-Address support in the binary codec and account sugar
- Method to the `Wallet` class that generates the X-Address for the wallet's account
- Async versions of all high-level functionality within the `xrpl.asyncio` package
- Web socket client under `xrpl.clients.WebsocketClient`
- Async web socket client under `xrpl.asyncio.clients.AsyncWebsocketClient`
- A general `from_dict` method for `Request` models, analogous to `Transaction.from_dict`

### Fixed
- Typos in docs/tests
- Improved readability of the README/documentation
- Expose `xrpl.utils` at the top level
- Expose `xrpl.accounts.get_account_root`
- Issue with calculating IOU precision
- Invalid X-Addresses in the XRPL Binary Codec now error with `XRPLBinaryCodecException` instead of `ValueError`
- Issues with converting certain dictionaries to/from a model using `BaseModel.from_dict`
- Better error message reporting

## [1.0.0] - 2021-03-31
