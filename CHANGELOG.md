- Currency codes with special characters not being allowed by IssuedCurrency objects.

- Support for `server_definitions` RPC

### Fixed

- Fixed issue in `get_nftoken_id` where error is opaque when there are no `NFTokenPage`s

### Changed

- Removed amm-devnet faucet support as is will soon be decommissioned

## [2.4.0] - 2023-09-27
### Added

- Support for [XLS-38d (XChainBridge)](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-38d-XChainBridge)

### Fixed
- Update request models related to AMM
- Better error handling for when a `Wallet` is passed into an account or destination field

## [2.3.0] - 2023-08-24
### Added
- Add AMM support [XLS-30](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/78)

## [2.2.0] - 2023-08-07
### Added
- Added new `Clawback` transaction as per [XLS-39](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/94)

## [2.1.0] - 2023-07-24
### Fixed
- Replaced alias for `classic_address` with separate property to work around this mypy issue:
  https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/6700

## [2.0.0] - 2023-07-05
### Added:
- Wallet support for regular key compatibility
- Added new ways of wallet generation: `from_seed`, `from_secret`, `from_entropy`, `from_secret_numbers`
- Added `address` alias to `Wallet.classic_address`
  - Replaced `Wallet.classic_address` with `Wallet.address` to avoid confusion. (`classic_address` is the same as your XRPL account `address`, and is only called classic since it's an older standard than `x-address`)
- Added `network_id` to clients in order to use the `Client` with networks beyond mainnet

### Changed:
- Updated params for `Wallet` class constructor
- `Wallet.address` is now readonly
- Removed `sequence` from `Wallet` class
- Core keypairs generate seed must take in hexstring instead of bytestring
- Core keypairs formatting for `ED25519` is now padded with zeros if length of keystring is less than 64
- Removed deprecated request wrappers (the preferred method is to directly do client.request instead)
- `AccountSetFlagInterface` now operates on transaction `tf` flags (as opposed to `asf` flags)
- `sign` is now synchronous instead of async (done by removing the optional `check_fee` param & moving checks up to other functions)
- In order to be internally consistent, all signing/submitting functions will follow the parameter order of `transaction`, `client`, `wallet`, and then other parameters. (This is because `wallet` is optional for `submit_and_wait` and so must come after `client`)
- `XRP.to_amount` now converts from XRP to drops, instead of expecting a drops amount

### Fixed:
- Added a sort of the account IDs in `multisign`, so that the `multisign` always works.
- Add `ledger_hash` and `ledger_index` to `account_nfts`, `nft_buy_offers`, and `nft_sell_offers` requests.
- Add `nft_page` to `ledger_entry` request.

### Removed:
- `send_reliable_submission` has been replaced by `submit_and_wait`
- Longer aliases for signing/submitting functions have been removed. Specifically
  - `submit_transaction` is now `submit`
  - `safe_sign_transaction` is now `sign`
  - `safe_sign_and_submit_transaction` is now `sign_and_submit`
    - The param order for `sign_and_submit` moves `wallet` after `client` to be consistent with `submit_and_wait`
  - `safe_sign_and_autofill_transaction` is now `autofill_and_sign`
    - The param order for `autofill_and_sign` moves `wallet` after `client` to be consistent with `submit_and_wait`
- Removed deprecated request functions which were just wrappers around `Client.request()`. Specifically this includes:
  - `get_account_info`
  - `get_account_transactions`
  - `get_account_payment_transactions`
  - `get_transaction_from_hash`

## [1.9.0] - 2023-06-13
### Added:
- Added `submit_and_wait` to sign (if needed), autofill, submit a transaction and wait for its final outcome
- `submit` and `send_reliable_submission` now accept an optional boolean param `fail_hard` (if `True` halt the submission if it's not immediately validated)
- Added sidechain devnet support to faucet generation
- Added `user_agent` and `usage_context` to `generate_faucet_wallet`

### Changed:
- Allowed keypairs.sign to take a hex string in addition to bytes

### Fixed:
- Refactored `does_account_exist` and `get_balance` to avoid deprecated methods and use `ledger_index` parameter
- Fixed crashes in the `SignerListSet` validation
- Improved error messages in `send_reliable_submission`
- Better error handling in reliable submission

### Removed:
- RPCs and utils related to the old sidechain design

## [1.8.0] - 2023-04-10
### Added:
- Created function alias to `safe_sign_transaction` called `sign` - safe originally used to indicate local offline signing (keys aren't exposed)
- Created function alias to `safe_sign_and_autofill_transaction` called `autofill_and_sign` to reflect order of operations
- Created function alias to `submit_transaction` called `submit`
- Created function alias to `safe_sign_and_submit_transaction` called `sign_and_submit`
- AccountSetFlags for disallowing incoming objects (e.g. `asf_disallow_incoming_trustline`)
- Added `getNFTokenID` to get the NFTokenID after minting a token.
- Added `LedgerEntryType` enum and added `type` field to `Ledger` and `LedgerData` requests
- Added the algorithm used to encode a wallet's seed to the wallet.

### Changed:
- `check_fee` now has a higher limit that is less likely to be hit
- When connected hooks v2 testnet generate_faucet_wallet now defaults to using the faucet instead of requiring specification
- Deprecated `get_account_info`, `get_transaction_from_hash`, `get_account_payment_transactions` for direct requests
- Private function `request_impl` has been renamed to `_request_impl`. Users should always use `request` over `request_impl`.
- Removed nft-devnet faucet support as it has been decommissioned ([Blog Post](https://xrpl.org/blog/2023/nft-devnet-decommission.html))

### Fixed:
- Properly type the instance functions of NestedModel
- Add additional check to `txnNotFound` error from `reliable_submission` due to race condition
- Add `nft_offer` type in `AccountObjects`
- Handle errors better in `send_reliable_submission`
- Made `send_reliable_submission` wait the full duration until `LastLedgerSequence` passes by
