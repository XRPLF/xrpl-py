    Given a transaction hash, fetch the corresponding transaction from the ledger.

    Args:
        tx_hash: the transaction hash.
        client: the network client used to communicate with a rippled node.
        binary: If true, return transaction data and metadata as binary
            serialized to hexadecimal strings. If false, return transaction data and
            metadata as JSON. The default is false.
        min_ledger: Use this with max_ledger to specify a range of up to
            1000 ledger indexes, starting with this ledger (inclusive). If the server
            cannot find the transaction, it confirms whether it was able to search all
            the ledgers in this range.

    Returns:
