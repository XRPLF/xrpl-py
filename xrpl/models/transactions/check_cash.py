"""
Represents a CheckCash transaction on the XRP ledger. CheckCash transactions
attempt to redeem a Check object in the ledger to receive up to the amount
authorized by the corresponding CheckCreate transaction. Only the Destination
address of a Check can cash it with a CheckCash transaction. Cashing a check
this way is similar to executing a Payment initiated by the destination.

Since the funds for a check are not guaranteed, redeeming a Check can fail
because the sender does not have a high enough balance or because there is
not enough liquidity to deliver the funds. If this happens, the Check remains
in the ledger and the destination can try to cash it again later, or for a
different amount.
