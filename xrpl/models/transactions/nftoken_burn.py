    The NFTokenBurn transaction is used to remove an NFToken object from the
    NFTokenPage in which it is being held, effectively removing the token from
    the ledger ("burning" it).

    If this operation succeeds, the corresponding NFToken is removed. If this
    operation empties the NFTokenPage holding the NFToken or results in the
    consolidation, thus removing an NFTokenPage, the ownerâ€™s reserve requirement
    is reduced by one.
