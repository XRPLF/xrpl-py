"""
The sign method takes a transaction in JSON format and a seed value, and returns a
signed binary representation of the transaction. To contribute one signature to a
multi-signed transaction, use the sign_for method instead.

By default, this method is admin-only. It can be used as a public method if the server
has enabled public signing.

Caution:
Unless you run the rippled server yourself, you should do local signing with RippleAPI
instead of using this command. An untrustworthy server could change the transaction
before signing it, or use your secret key to sign additional arbitrary transactions as
if they came from you.
