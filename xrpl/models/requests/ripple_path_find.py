"""
The ripple_path_find method is a simplified version of the
path_find method that provides a single response with a payment
path you can use right away. It is available in both the WebSocket
and JSON-RPC APIs. However, the results tend to become outdated as
time passes. Instead of making multiple calls to stay updated, you
should instead use the path_find method to subscribe to continued
updates where possible.

Although the rippled server tries to find the cheapest path or
combination of paths for making a payment, it is not guaranteed that
the paths returned by this method are, in fact, the best paths.
