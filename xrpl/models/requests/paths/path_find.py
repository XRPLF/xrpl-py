"""
WebSocket API only! The path_find method searches for a
path along which a transaction can possibly be made, and
periodically sends updates when the path changes over time.
For a simpler version that is supported by JSON-RPC, see the
ripple_path_find method. For payments occurring strictly in XRP,
it is not necessary to find a path, because XRP can be sent
directly to any account.

There are three different modes, or sub-commands, of the path_find
command. Specify which one you want with the subcommand parameter:

create - Start sending pathfinding information
close - Stop sending pathfinding information
status - Get the information of the currently-open pathfinding request
Although the rippled server tries to find the cheapest path or combination
of paths for making a payment, it is not guaranteed that the paths returned
by this method are, in fact, the best paths. Due to server load,
pathfinding may not find the best results. Additionally, you should be
careful with the pathfinding results from untrusted servers. A server
could be modified to return less-than-optimal paths to earn money for its
operators. If you do not have your own server that you can trust with
pathfinding, you should compare the results of pathfinding from multiple
servers run by different parties, to minimize the risk of a single server
returning poor results. (Note: A server returning less-than-optimal
results is not necessarily proof of malicious behavior; it could also be
a symptom of heavy server load.)
