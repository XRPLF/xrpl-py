hold the MPToken, which will be deleted as a result. If the holder&#39;s MPToken has a non-zero balance
while trying to set this flag, the transaction fails. On the other hand, if set, and transaction is
submitted by an issuer, it would mean that the issuer wants to unauthorize the holder (only applicable
for allow-listing), which would unset the lsfMPTAuthorized flag on the MPToken.
