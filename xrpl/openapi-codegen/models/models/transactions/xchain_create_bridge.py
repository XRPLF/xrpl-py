    The XChainCreateBridge transaction creates a new Bridge ledger object and defines a new
    cross-chain bridge entrance on the chain that the transaction is submitted on. It
    includes information about door accounts and assets for the bridge.  The transaction
    must be submitted first by the locking chain door account. To set up a valid bridge,
    door accounts on both chains must submit this transaction, in addition to setting up
    witness servers.  The complete production-grade setup would also include a SignerListSet
    transaction on the two door accounts for the witnesses’ signing keys, as well as
    disabling the door accounts’ master key. This ensures that the witness servers are truly
    in control of the funds.
