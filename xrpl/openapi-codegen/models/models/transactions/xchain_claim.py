    The XChainClaim transaction completes a cross-chain transfer of value. It allows a user
    to claim the value on the destination chain - the equivalent of the value locked on the
    source chain. A user can only claim the value if they own the cross-chain claim ID
    associated with the value locked on the source chain (the Account field). The user can
    send the funds to anyone (the Destination field). This transaction is only needed if an
    OtherChainDestination isn't specified in the XChainCommit transaction, or if something
    goes wrong with the automatic transfer of funds.  If the transaction succeeds in moving
    funds, the referenced XChainOwnedClaimID ledger object will be destroyed. This prevents
    transaction replay. If the transaction fails, the XChainOwnedClaimID won't be destroyed
    and the transaction can be re-run with different parameters.
