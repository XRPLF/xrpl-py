    The NFTokenBurn transaction is used to remove a NFToken object from the NFTokenPage in
    which it is being held, effectively removing the token from the ledger (burning it).
    The sender of this transaction must be the owner of the NFToken to burn; or, if the
    NFToken has the lsfBurnable flag enabled, can be the issuer or the issuer's authorized
    NFTokenMinter account instead.  If this operation succeeds, the corresponding NFToken is
    removed. If this operation empties the NFTokenPage holding the NFToken or results in
    consolidation, thus removing a NFTokenPage, the ownerâ€™s reserve requirement is reduced
    by one.
