    The MPTokenIssuanceCreate transaction creates an MPTokenIssuance object and adds it to
    the relevant directory node of the creator account. This transaction is the only
    opportunity an issuer has to specify any token fields that are defined as immutable (for
    example, MPT Flags).  If the transaction is successful, the newly created token is owned
    by the account (the creator account) that executed the transaction.  Whenever your query
    returns an MPTokenIssuance transaction response, there will always be an mpt_issuance_id
    field on the Transaction Metadata page.

    (Optional) An asset scale is the difference, in orders of magnitude, between a standard
    unit and a corresponding fractional unit. More formally, the asset scale is a
    non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, â€¦) such that one standard unit equals 10^(-scale) of a
    corresponding fractional unit. If the fractional unit equals the standard unit, then the
