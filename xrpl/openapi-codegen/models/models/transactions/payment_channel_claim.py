    Claim XRP from a payment channel, adjust the payment channel's expiration, or both.
    This transaction can be used differently depending on the transaction sender's role in
    the specified channel:  The source address of a channel can: - Send XRP from the channel
    to the destination with or without a signed Claim. - Set the channel to expire as soon
    as the channel's SettleDelay has passed. - Clear a pending Expiration time. - Close a
    channel immediately, with or without processing a claim first. The source address cannot
    close the channel immediately if the channel has XRP remaining.  The destination address
    of a channel can: - Receive XRP from the channel using a signed Claim. - Close the
    channel immediately after processing a Claim, refunding any unclaimed XRP to the
    channel's source.  Any address sending this transaction can: - Cause a channel to be
    closed if its Expiration or CancelAfter time is older than the previous ledger's close
    time. Any validly-formed PaymentChannelClaim transaction has this effect regardless of
    the contents of the transaction.
