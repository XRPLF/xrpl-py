    Claw back tokens issued by your account.  Clawback is disabled by default. To use
    clawback, you must send an AccountSet transaction to enable the Allow Trust Line
    Clawback setting. An issuer with any existing tokens cannot enable Clawback. You can
    only enable Allow Trust Line Clawback if you have a completely empty owner directory,
    meaning you must do so before you set up any trust lines, offers, escrows, payment
    channels, checks, or signer lists. After you enable Clawback, it cannot be reverted: the
    account permanently gains the ability to claw back issued assets on trust lines.
