    Generates a random wallet and funds it using the XRPL Testnet Faucet.

    Args:
        client: the network client used to make network calls.
        wallet: the wallet to fund. If omitted or `None`, a new wallet is created.
        debug: Whether to print debug information as it creates the wallet.
        faucet_host: A custom host to use for funding a wallet. In environments other
            than devnet and testnet, this parameter is required.
        usage_context: The intended use case for the funding request
            (for example, testing). This information will be included in json body

    Returns:
        A Wallet on the testnet that contains some amount of XRP.

        XRPLFaucetException: if an address could not be funded with the faucet.
        XRPLRequestFailureException: if a request to the ledger fails.
