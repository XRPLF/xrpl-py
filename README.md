# xrpl-py

A pure Python implementation for interacting with the XRP Ledger. The `xrpl-py` library simplifies the hardest parts of XRP Ledger interaction, like serialization and transaction signing, by providing native Python models for [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/ledger-data-formats.html) and core server [API](https://xrpl.org/api-conventions.html) ([`rippled`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled))  objects.



```py
>>> import xrpl
>>> import xrpl.keypairs
>>> xrpl.keypairs.generate_seed()
